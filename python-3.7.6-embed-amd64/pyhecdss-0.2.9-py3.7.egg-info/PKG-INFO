        For reading/writing HEC-DSS files [https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-dss/]
        HEC-DSS is an ancient database used by the Army Corps of Engineers and prevalent
        in water related models. This module is a bridge to read and write time series
        data from this data format and read it into pandas DataFrame
        
        * Free software: MIT license
        * Documentation: https://cadwrdeltamodeling.github.io/pyhecdss/
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Open and close DSS files
        * Read catalog of DSS files as pandas DataFrame
        * Read and write time series from DSS files
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        * Only support for Python 3 - 64 bit for windows and linux
